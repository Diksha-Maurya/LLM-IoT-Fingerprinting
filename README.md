# LLM-IoT-Fingerprinting

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and classify IoT devices based on their network traffic patterns. By converting packet-level features from PCAP data into structured textual representations, the model learns to distinguish devices through fine-tuned classification. The approach enables device fingerprinting without relying on traditional handcrafted features, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in cybersecurity and network forensics.
